# 🐍 SnakeSense App

**SnakeSense App** is a simple Flutter application that leverages the [SnakeSense](https://github.com/lostplusfound/SnakeSense/) machine learning model to classify snake species and identify whether a snake is venomous or not. Users can either select an image from their device or take a new photo, and the app performs inference to display species information in a user-friendly way.
